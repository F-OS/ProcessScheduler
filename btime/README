To build on windows:

Using a recent version of VC++, such as 2012, 2013, or 2015, open btime.vcxproj, switch to release configuration, and compile. The dll will be output in the Release folder.

To build on linux:

Ensure the build environment is installed and gnu make and g++ are available. On debian/ubuntu machines, installing build-essential should be sufficient.

From the btime directory:
make && sudo make install
